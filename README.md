# Personal Website

## Project Status: Finished (but will be improved)

### This repository is for my personal website to check it out, [CLICK HERE](https://haneulkim214.github.io/)

What I've done so far:

- I've studied basics of HTML5 and CSS3 then came across bootstrap4 framework which made it easier to create a website. It took me a while since I've tried to understand all different classes in bootstrap4 and how they work.


Improvements:

- I am going to use Flask with python to create backend part of my website also try to create repeating grids like col-md-4 by using for loop thus save more time.
